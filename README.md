# RVCC AI Club LinkTree

## Overview
This repository hosts the RVCC AI Club's LinkTree Project, an innovative platform designed to centralize and simplify access to the club's key resources, events, and updates. This project demonstrates back-end functionality that leverages AI to interact dynamically with users and provide relevant information.

  **Note:** This project is still under development. Currently, the program generates answers based on data stored in .txt files, using OpenAI's GPT model to handle user queries and produce accurate, AI-driven responses.

## Features
  - AI-Powered Responses: Answers user questions dynamically by processing .txt file data.
  - Streamlined Back-End: Provides foundational functionality for future front-end integration.
  - OpenAI GPT Integration: Utilizes OpenAI's API to generate accurate and context-aware answers.

## Future Development
  - Enhanced Functionality: Expand the chatbot to process multiple file formats and integrate real-time updates.
  - Front-End Integration: Develop a web interface for a user-friendly LinkTree experience.
  - Automated Data Management: Enable dynamic updates to the .txt files for better information accuracy.
