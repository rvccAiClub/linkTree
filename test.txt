Our meetings are broken down into informative meetings and presentation days. On informative meeting days, the meeting will be structured around important topics including how to study for the MCAT, to how to get yourself involved in volunteering abroad. On presentation days, our committee officers gather their research about research opportunities, internship opportunities, and volunteer opportunities and present them to the club with the following application links to apply to. The purpose of these days is to educate all members of opportunities that they can apply for to build their resume for a competitive pre-medicine resume.
As a pre-medicine club member, you come to weekly meetings that occur during college hour. As a group, we will start each meeting off with a medical related video, and then move into our informative topic for the day. We brainstorm of things we can be doing to get a head start on the process (for example, if we are talking about the MCAT that day, we will think and outline all of the routes you could be successful in studying for the MCAT and achieve a high score). At the end of the meeting is when we put our heads together to think of a good team activity for the month such as building first aid kits for the less fortunate and bake sales to raise money for the club. Leadership positions are available and are encouraged!
